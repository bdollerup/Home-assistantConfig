# My Smarter House Setup
Home Assistant configuration &amp; Documentation for my smarter house.

This is the working configuration of my Smart Home.

This Repo is meant for inspiration. The configuration, devices, layout, and automations should help inspire you to start controlling your home using all kind of devices. 

Please note that this is work and doesn't necessarily represent best practices and/or cutting edge.

## Docker
I use Docker to host my Home Assistant setup on a Raspberry Pi. I've included my Docker Compose file for reference. I keep API keys, username, password and other sensitive information in a separate .env file (not included).

## Ansible
I use Ansible to configure and maintain my Raspberry Pi's.
